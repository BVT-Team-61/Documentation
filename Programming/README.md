# Programming
The software that runs on the robot.

## [Programming Style](Style/README.md)
Indenting, naming, newlines.

## [Sensors](Sensors/README.md)
Sensors are needed for autonomous. Encoders and gyroscopes are essential at a minimum. Ultrasonic sensors and accelerometers are useful for increasing accuracy. **Timers alone are not enough.**
