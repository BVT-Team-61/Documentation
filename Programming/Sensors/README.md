# Sensors
The devices that obtain input from outside the robot.

## Types of Sensors
* Timer - Used for delays between items.
* Encoders - Used to determine the distance that a certain motor has moved.
* Ultrasonic - Used to roughly determine the distance between the robot and something else.
* Gyroscope - Used to determine the orientation of the robot relative to where it started.
* Accelerometer - Used to correct for drift from the encoders.
